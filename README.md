## Utilizing some classic non-parametric tests, I performed statistical analysis on two simulated datasets of a Computer Game Company (let's call it WSG) to support their strategy based on player behaviour.

Dataset 1: *New feature.csv* records the number of daily active players. WSG implemented a new feature to their game, and we would like to know whether this new feature has attracted more players to stay online!

Dataset 2: *Player hours.csv* records the player online hours. WSG developed a new game and opened the beta to a small number of players. How sticky are players with this game?
